  Compiling WolfMUD from source

DESCRIPTION

  This document describes details for compiling WolfMUD from source code. This
  can either be from one of the source code downloads or from a Git clone.

PREREQUISITES

  It is assumed that Go has already been downloaded and installed. If not Go
  can be obtained from https://golang.org or it may be available from your
  package manager.

  A minimum of Go 1.18 is required to compile WolfMUD. Using the latest
  version of Go available is recommended.

COMPILING ON LINUX OR WINDOWS

  To compile WolfMUD open a terminal or command window and change to the
  directory where the sources were unarchived, or the directory where the Git
  repository was cloned to. This defaults to the WolfMUD directory in both
  cases. At the command prompt execute the command:

    go build -o bin ./...

  The server executable will be placed in the bin directory. For details on
  running the server see running-the-server.txt for details.
